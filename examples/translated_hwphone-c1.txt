At the end of 2003, Huawei entered the mobile phone terminal market relatively late. The competition in CDMA was fierce, and GSM was a red ocean, with WCDMA still on the horizon. Huawei's terminal units achieved effective differentiated competition in the niche data card market, leading in cost efficiency and continuous product and technological innovations, becoming the global leader by sustaining itself through these niche markets. Huawei's mobile venture began with system equipment support, opting for carrier-customized solutions, which initially seemed like the path of least resistance. However, history has proven this approach to be unsustainable, and only innovation could provide an escape from the intense competition in these oversaturated markets.1. For many years, mobile phones have been sustained by simple data cards.3G introduced numerous new experiences for consumers, notably through laptop-integrated 3G data cards, which provided high-speed internet access and became the most popular application during the early stages of WCDMA development. 3G phones required support from chip manufacturers and screen suppliers, among others. The design was influenced by fashion trends, while the phone's battery life depended on the supplier's capabilities. Mass production presented challenges, including those related to mold technology, resulting in longer research and production cycles and substantial capital requirements. Compared to phones, the data card featured a relatively straightforward design, primarily providing internet access and demanding high technical capability in wireless protocols. This represents a long-standing advantage for Huawei in the wireless sector.

Crucially, major mobile terminal manufacturers such as Nokia and Ericsson underestimated the small data card, considering it technologically unsophisticated beyond its chip. This oversight left Huawei with an important niche market. In November 2004, Huawei Terminal launched the WCDMA/GPRS dual-mode phone U626 and the WCDMA single-mode phone U326 in Hong Kong. In early December 2004, Huawei Terminal's WCDMA/GPRS data card E600 was officially sold in Hong Kong through SmarTone, becoming popular. Huawei secured a procurement order from the Hong Kong operator SmarTone, striking the first 'gold mine' in the 3G data card market. In the first half of 2005, Huawei's WCDMA phones and data cards entered the procurement lists of mainstream European operators. At the same time, leveraging the data card, a product considered minor by competitors, Huawei Terminal adopted a boutique strategy, focusing on appearance design and differentiated technology, and collaborated with Vodafone to provide customized data card products E618, E620, E220, etc. In just the year 2005, Huawei Terminal launched nearly ten data card models, with a rich range of product forms including data cards, modems, and covering multiple standards such as HSDPA, WCDMA, EDGE, GPRS, CDMA 2000 1x/EV-DO, such as E612, E620, CDMA data card EC321, and USB Modem product EC325. Among them, Huawei's HSDPA USB Modem E220 was not only suitable for portable computers but also for desktops.

Despite competitors viewing the data card as a minor product, Huawei Terminal adopted a boutique strategy, focusing on appearance design and differentiated technology, making Huawei data cards compact and superior in appearance and technical specifications compared to competitors. Previously, data cards required software installation and password entry at each startup, which was inconvenient. Huawei transformed the data card into a plug-and-play device, with software automatically installing upon first use and subsequent one-click login, a foolproof design that made Huawei Terminal stand out. The E220 data card, in particular, had a large shipment volume, with global sales reaching 9 million units, sparking a global craze for this type of plug-and-play internet card.Early data cards required a cable to connect to computers, which was inconvenient during use. To ensure a better customer experience, after the launch of Huawei's USB interface data cards, Huawei introduced a rotating wireless data card, the first-ever cable-free model, which was more compact and convenient. In 2008, this innovative rotating wireless data card was awarded the Best Mobile Broadband Device by GSMA, marking the first time a Chinese company received this award. In 2009, Huawei launched the E5 wireless data card with WiFi connectivity, which could support internet access for up to five devices simultaneously: iPad, iTouch, PSP, laptops, and other portable devices. Integrating three, four, and five network modes, it provided ultra-high-speed connectivity across various network standards, showcasing Huawei's innovation in wireless communication RF and various protocol technologies, dominating the industry for a period. In 2005, Huawei's UMTS/HSDPA data card products were renowned for their leading technology, high-quality, comprehensive models, and rapid delivery. They successively made it onto the procurement lists of top global operators such as Vodafone, Hutchison, Telefonica, and T-Mobile. In 2007, Huawei's data cards won the IF Award, and in 2008, the Red Dot Award. The E510 was Huaweiâ€™s first 3.5G data card globally to feature mobile TV capabilities. The Huawei E510, as the world's smallest and thinnest 2M HSUPA device supporting DVB-T and DVB-H, could achieve up to 4.5 Mbps HSUPA uplink speeds (see Figure 18-1). Computers connected to the E510 could directly receive TV signals, providing smooth and clear picture quality comparable to that of television sets. It was suitable for both laptops and desktop PCs.In 2005, Huawei's wireless terminal business generated over 4.3 billion yuan in sales revenue, with more than 10 million units shipped, including over 3 million CDMA mobile phones. UMTS and HSDPA data cards were provided to European operators, and the cumulative market share for PHS reached 13%. Facing fierce competition in both CDMA and PHS mobile phones from companies such as ZTE, Huawei's mobile terminals predominantly depended on 3G data cards, which generated profits of several hundred yuan each, far exceeding the mere tens of yuan profit from mobile phone products.With the expansion of the 3G network, the European 3G data card market started to develop from 2006, initially dominated by international brands such as OPTION, SIERRA, and NOVATEL, which increasingly faced competitive pressure from Huawei. Huawei's long-time rival, ZTE, had been developing and manufacturing mobile phones since 1998, and by 2002, had identified mobile phones as one of its three strategic core business areas. Based on years of development and production experience in PHS, CDMA, and GSM mobile phones, by 2007, ZTE had become China's largest mobile phone company by annual shipment volume, exceeding ten million units. ZTE quickly recognized that Huawei's terminal business, established just three years prior, was achieving significant breakthroughs in the European CDMA, 3G, and data card markets, particularly noting that data cards were a major source of profit for the newly established Huawei terminal company. In 2007, ZTE initiated a price war against Huawei's data cards, with a strategy to scale up through aggressive low pricing, aiming to undercut Huawei's data card prices and thereby sever Huawei terminal's profit sources, pushing the company into financial difficulties. While ZTE was the visible competitor, Qualcomm was the significant force behind the scenes, orchestrating the strategy. In 2004, this partnership was further solidified when Qualcomm introduced its WCDMA technology.Qualcomm's HSDPA chip technology, after undergoing large-scale commercial trials by Huawei in 2005 and 2006, urgently needed to scale up. Qualcomm aimed to exploit the rivalry between ZTE and Huawei in Europe to further squeeze out competitors and swiftly expand to achieve its strategic goal of completely monopolizing the 3G chip market. Option, the former European data card sales champion, once held a 72% market share in 2006, which plummeted to 27% in 2007. The price war in the market in 2007 was not just 10% but plummeted by 40% to 50%. Huawei's data cards, all based on Qualcomm's baseband solutions, required annual renegotiations between the two companies as they lowered prices and increased market supply. Post-2007, Huawei frequently faced stockouts of data card chips, while ZTE could deliver normally, leading Huawei to often lose orders to ZTE. The underlying reason was Qualcomm's priority support strategy for ZTE. Due to frequent chip shortages, Huawei was determined to adopt a "dual supplier" strategy. However, Qualcomm was the only global supplier of 3G baseband chips, so Huawei had to quickly break through in baseband chip technology. At the end of 2007, Huawei veteran Wang Jin was swiftly reassigned from Europe back to Shanghai to take charge of the newly established cross-terminal division and the wireless chip development department at HiSilicon, initiating the HiSilicon Balong (baseband) chip project, with the primary goal of breaking through in WCDMA data card chips. In 2009, the wireless chip development department developed the WCDMA data card chip, which supported Huawei's data cards in becoming number one globally in terms of performance, cost, and delivery speed. In 2009, the global sales volume of data cards was around 80 million units, with Huawei's shipments reaching 35 million units (compared to only 1.5 million units in 2005 and 2006), and ZTE's at about 20 million units, together accounting for nearly 70% of the market share. In Europe alone, Huawei's market share of data cards exceeded 70%. With a profit of 50 yuan per data card, the 35 million units shipped brought Huawei's terminal business a profit of 1.75 billion yuan. In the economically challenging year of 2009, Huawei's data cards were used in the networks of 315 operators across 133 countries and regions, with shipments reaching 60 million units. According to ABI's data on global market shares for wireless data cards from 2005 to 2010, Huawei has been the global leader in data cards since 2007, reaching a global market share of 46.8% by 2010.Option is the sole European manufacturer of wireless network cards, USB flash drives, and embedded notebook internet modules. In June 2010, Option petitioned the EU to launch two investigations into Chinese data cards for anti-dumping and safeguard measures, primarily targeting Huawei and ZTE Corporation. These two Chinese mobile device companies had already secured 90% of the EU data card market share. This case marked the first instance where the EU simultaneously conducted anti-dumping, anti-subsidy, and trade safeguard investigations on the same exported product from China. In October 2010, Huawei announced an official agreement with the Belgian wireless network equipment manufacturer Option: Huawei would collaborate with the company on R&D in the communications sector and establish a Belgian R&D center. Huawei also agreed to purchase a license for Option's connection management software, with the first year's licensing fee totaling 27 million euros (approximately 37.68 million US dollars). Additionally, Huawei agreed to acquire all the circulating shares of Option's semiconductor company M4S for 8 million euros (approximately 11.05 million US dollars). Following the agreement, Option withdrew its complaint, prompting the EU to cease the triple-pronged investigations. In June 2010, ZTE Corporation captured 60% of the UK data card market; on April 28, 2011, Huawei filed lawsuits against ZTE Corporation in Germany, France, and Hungary, accusing it of infringing on a series of patents related to data cards and LTE technology, and illegally using Huawei's registered trademarks on data card products without Huawei's permission. Huawei lost the case in March 2013. This lawsuit signified a shift from market-level competition to patent competition between Huawei and ZTE Corporation over many years. Subsequently, both parties increased their patent investments in the mobile terminal field. In May 2012, the EU alleged that ZTE Corporation and Huawei, after receiving illegal government subsidies, sold data card products in Europe at prices below cost. If the EU deemed China's actions illegal, Huawei and ZTE Corporation might have to pay punitive EU tariffs. However, two days later, Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications giant, publicly opposed the EU, stating: "Ericsson is a strong supporter of free trade, and we do not agree with such unilateral measures. Actions by the EU targeting specific Chinese companies could trigger a vicious cycle." Ericsson accounts for about 30% of the global and Chinese WCDMA equipment market, with China being the largest global WCDMA market. Ericsson opposed the EU's sanctions against Huawei and ZTE Corporation, mainly fearing becoming a casualty in a trade war between China and the EU. Meanwhile, Huawei presented evidence that its external financing did not exceed 15% of its cash flow, and it did not receive government subsidies. AfterwardThe European Union withdrew its investigation into Huawei. Generating substantial profits and brand influence for an emerging product line does not necessarily require the most advanced or complex technology; Huawei's data card is a prime example of this. In product development, it is crucial to delve deeply and strive for excellence, possessing a global competitive edge. It's essential to fully optimize every detail of cost, technology, supply chain, and market demand to maximize global market presence. Competitors always keep a watchful eye. When in a competitive pack, any initial advantage can quickly be lost. Cost competition, supply chain challenges, technological advancements, intellectual property conflicts, and international trade conflicts can arise unexpectedly, leaving companies unprepared. Ultimately, the victor is the company that not only possesses multiple strengths but also excels in integrating all aspects of technology, intellectual property, cost management, and supply chain to meet customer needs effectively.2. Unpacking the Predicament of OEM Customized PhonesMobile phones are consumer products that require fashionable designs to attract buyers, while also necessitating advanced wireless communication technology, particularly in terms of protocols and standards such as GSM, CDMA, CDMA2000, GPRS, and WCDMA. These standards are available in various modes like dual-mode, tri-mode, and penta-mode, which significantly elevate the technical complexity of mobile phone development. The development cost of a mobile phone can reach tens of millions of yuan, with production costs exceeding hundreds of millions of yuan, creating high barriers to entry in the industry. Thus, before 2004, only large enterprises with substantial capital were manufacturing mobile phones, and the prices of these phones were generally above 2000 yuan. However, this high barrier was broken by Taiwan's MediaTek, which kickstarted the intense competition in China's mobile phone market. In 1999, MediaTek was primarily a company developing optical storage technology and DVD chips. By 2001, MediaTek's CEO, Ming-Kai Tsai, fully committed to the development of mobile phone chips, making it the company's top priority and aggressively hiring talent and investing in technology. MediaTek's first mobile phone chip was launched in 2003, but no mobile phone manufacturers were willing to invest heavily in developing phones based on its chips. In 2004, Tsai partnered with Terry Gou, chairman of the Foxconn Technology Group, to establish a mobile phone design company called Daxi, which designed mobile phone hardware according to manufacturers' specifications, significantly lowering the barriers to mobile phone development. MediaTek also discovered that mainland Chinese mobile users frequently used MP3 players and FM radios, so it integrated a complete multimedia solution into its phone designs. This led MediaTek to create a new model within the chip industry: adopting a strategy of differentiated functionality and providing mobile phone manufacturers with integrated one-stop services for both hardware and software design. MediaTek integrated multimedia systems (for handling audio and video functions) and baseband chips (which process communication functions) into the motherboard, supplied screens and cameras, and provided a complete BOM price list, technical solutions, and its own developed operating system. Mobile phone manufacturers simply needed to purchase this complete solution, put it in a casing, and proceed to production. What originally required a year of development and tens of millions of yuan in investment could now be completed in just three months with MediaTek's solution, greatly reducing both the development cycle and capital requirements. Soon, the Shenzhen Huaqiangbei market formed an industry chain centered around MediaTek, with specialized companies copying the designs of major brands like Nokia and Ericsson, mass-producing casings, and designing and producing phone casings that sold for 300 yuan in regular markets but were available in Huaqiangbei for less than 30 yuan. There were also companies that specifically purchased MediaTek chips and major electronic components in Hong Kong and brought them to Huaqiangbei through various means, either through regular imports or other channels, and then found nearby factories to produce the phone motherboards, providing a one-stop service solution that covered everything from capital to logistics and the supply chain. From 2004 onwards, tens of thousands of mobile phone companies emerged across China, most of them engaged in the production of generic branded phones, which are unbranded or carry the brand of another company. The profit margins on mobile phones in the market quickly dropped from hundreds of yuan to just a few yuan, and the unit price of phones dropped from over 2000 yuan to just three to four hundred yuan. The Huaqiangbei market adopted the black phone and shanzhai (imitation) phone model: without regard for copyright infringement, they copied the appearances of major brands like Motorola and Nokia, launched products simultaneously with these major brands, but at a price that was just one-tenth of the originals. They also differentiated themselves through features like high volume and pre-loaded popular songs. Most of the large domestic phone manufacturers quickly declined during the fierce competition from 2004 to 2005. They were defeated not only by the 'ant soldiers' of Huaqiangbei nurtured by MediaTek but also by brands like Nokia, which maintained its position as the world's top mobile phone manufacturer by cooperating with carriers to offer ultra-low-end phones at two to three hundred yuan, effectively monopolizing the low-end market. Huawei's mobile terminal business started during a financially difficult period for Huawei, with insufficient funds for brand promotion for its terminal company, which had to find ways to sustain itself while being suppressed by domestic and international giants, and had to pay management and operation fees to the overall Huawei Group. Thus, in mid-2005, both Huawei and ZTE entered the European carrier's white-label custom machine market, finding a survival path for Chinese mobile phones: carrier customization! From 2005 onwards, ZTE's mobile phone sales jumped from 12 million units to 16 million units in 2006, and then to 31.06 million units in 2007, ranking sixth globally and achieving a 'triple jump' in three years. On February 16, 2006, Vodafone and Huawei signed a five-year global strategic cooperation agreement on 3G mobile phones. In September 2006, the two companies jointly launched the first 3G mobile phone branded by Vodafone, the V710, which sold 800,000 units within nine months of its launch, rapidly expanding Vodafone's user base and enhancing the relationship between Huawei and Vodafone, allowing the terminal company to find its footing within Huawei. In global markets, especially in mature markets such as Japan, the United States, and Western Europe, 70% to 80% of mobile phones are customized by carriers. With over three billion mobile users worldwide and a potential market of 4.5 billion users, with a one-third replacement rate and 70% customization rate, the potential annual sales volume of customized phones will exceed one billion units within a few years. Even in China, a market with a wide distribution of high, middle, and low-end customers and extremely diverse customer choices, the proportion of customized phones reached 19.8% in 2007, accounting for about one-fifth of the market. The advantages of carrier customization are self-evident: carriers dictate what kind of phones to push in the market and can quickly achieve sales through their extensive channels, reducing the costs of market research and marketing. More importantly, with the large-scale construction of 3G networks in Europe in 2005, carriers promoted 3G networks by offering high subsidies for talk time and data services, effectively allowing consumers to purchase contract phones at zero cost, which had a significant promotional effect. The only thing Huawei and ZTE did well was to develop and produce the custom phones required by carriers, without having to consider the costs and operations of marketing to channels and consumers, saving both money and effort. Due to the large volumes purchased by carriers, both Huawei and ZTE were able to quickly increase their phone sales through white-label custom phones. White-label custom phones allowed Huawei and ZTE to transform a product that was originally consumer-oriented (ToC) into one that catered to large business clients (ToB). Huawei and ZTE almost simultaneously launched a strategy focused on the top 100 global mobile operators: the operating income of the world's top 100 mobile operators in 2006 exceeded 961 billion pounds, accounting for more than 80% of the global market, with the top 20 operators alone accounting for 625 billion pounds, more than 65% of the total. However, the flaws of working with carriers on white-label custom machines gradually became apparent over time: carriers' demands were mostly for cheap, varied styles, with low requirements for quality and functions. More importantly, carriers almost exclusively followed one line: bidding, with the lowest bidder winning, allowing manufacturers like Huawei and ZTE to benefit from the intense competition among themselves. Before 2009, the supply chains of Huawei and ZTE were almost identical: chip, screen, and battery suppliers, with the only difference between different projects being which company was willing to bundle network system equipment with mobile phones for a slim profit in price wars. By completely handing over market channels and marketing to carriers, Huawei and ZTE gradually lost their market sense and operational capabilities. Once carriers canceled phone subsidies and reduced their phone purchase volumes, they undoubtedly faced a sudden market decline and a disaster of massive unsold inventory. Under MediaTek's influence, Qualcomm also followed up with similar reference designs, lowering the threshold for custom machines even further, increasing the number of entrants, and reducing the added value. Both Huawei and ZTE's white-label custom phones fell into a state of mere survival, with extremely low profit margins, yet they were trapped in a strange cycle of having sales volumes but being unwilling to give up.Electronic components were then imported into Huaqiang North through various means, either smuggled or through legitimate channels, and nearby SMT factories were found to manufacture the mobile phone motherboards, providing a one-stop service from financing to logistics and technical supply chain. Since 2004, tens of thousands of mobile phone companies of various sizes have emerged nationwide, most engaging in the production of white-label phones, either unbranded or using other companies' brands. The profit from mobile phones in the market quickly dropped from hundreds of yuan to just tens or even a few yuan. The unit price of mobile phones dropped rapidly from over 2000 yuan to just three to four hundred yuan. The Huaqiang North model of unauthorized phones and knockoff (shanzhai) phones: disregarding copyright infringement, they copied the designs of major brands like Motorola and Nokia, launching products simultaneously with these major brands but at a tenth of the price. At the same time, they pursued limited differentiation strategies such as higher volume and pre-installed popular songs. Most major domestic phone manufacturers rapidly declined due to fierce competition between 2004 and 2005. They were defeated by MediaTek-trained Huaqiang North forces, as well as by Nokia, which had the advantage of supply chain strength from its annual sales volume of over a hundred million units. To maintain its position as the world's leading mobile phone manufacturer, Nokia also cooperated annually with operators to push ultra-low-end models priced at two to three hundred yuan, effectively monopolizing the low-end market. Huawei's mobile division started during Huawei's financially tough times, lacking funds, and without a dedicated budget for brand promotion for the mobile division, which had to fend for itself under the pressure of domestic and international giants while paying management and operation fees to the entire Huawei Group. Thus, in mid-2005, both Huawei and ZTE entered the European operators' white-label phone market, finding a survival path for Chinese mobile phones: operator customization. From 2005 onwards, ZTE's mobile phone annual sales jumped from 12 million units to 16 million in 2006, and then to 31.06 million in 2007, ranking sixth globally and achieving a "three-level jump" in three years. On February 16, 2006, Vodafone and Huawei signed a five-year global strategic cooperation agreement on 3G mobile phones. In September 2006, the two parties jointly launched the first 3G mobile phone branded "Vodafone" V710, designed by Huawei, which sold 800,000 units in the first nine months after its launch, helping Vodafone rapidly expand its user base and strengthen its relationship with Huawei, allowing the mobile division to secure its position within Huawei. In global markets, especially in mature markets like Japan, the US, and Western Europe, 70% to 80% of mobile phones are customized by operators, with global mobile users exceeding 3 billion, based on a potential mobileCalculating the potential annual sales volume of customized phones to exceed one billion units within a few years, based on users, a one-third annual replacement rate, and 70% customized phone volume. Even in China, where customer distribution spans from high to low end and choices are highly diversified, the proportion of customized phones reached 19.8% in 2007, approximately one-fifth. The advantages of operator customization are clear: operators dictate what types of phones are marketed, and can rapidly achieve sales through their extensive channels, reducing market research and marketing costs. Importantly, in 2005, as 3G networks were being built on a large scale in the European market, operators promoted 3G networks by offering substantial subsidies for 3G phones, effectively allowing consumers to acquire contract phones for zero upfront cost. This had a significant promotional effect on consumers. Huawei and ZTE excelled by developing and manufacturing phones to carrier specifications, without needing to consider the costs and operations of marketing to channels and consumers, thus optimizing cost-efficiency and operational simplicity. Due to the large volumes purchased by operators, Huawei and ZTE could quickly increase their phone production through white-label customization. White-label customization allowed Huawei and ZTE to transform a product that was originally consumer-oriented (ToC) into one oriented towards business clients (ToB). Huawei and ZTE almost simultaneously initiated a strategy focused on the top 100 global mobile operators: the operational revenue of the top 100 mobile operators in 2006 exceeded 961 billion pounds (approximately 1.2 trillion USD), accounting for over 80% of the global market, with the top 20 alone accounting for more than 65% or 6.25 trillion pounds. However, the flaws of working with operators on white-label customization gradually became apparent over time: operator demands were often for cheaper, varied styles with less emphasis on quality and functionality. More critically, the operators followed a single line: tendering, where the lowest bidder wins, allowing operators to benefit from the competition among manufacturers like Huawei and ZTE. Before 2009, Huawei and ZTE's supply chains were nearly identical: chips, screens, battery suppliers, with the only difference between projects being which company was willing to bundle network system equipment with phone profits to win a slim margin in price wars. By handing over all market channels and marketing to the operators, Huawei and ZTE gradually lost their market sensitivity and operational capabilities. Once operators cut phone subsidies and reduced phone purchase volumes, they undoubtedly faced a sudden market decline and a catastrophic buildup of inventory. Driven by MediaTek's initiatives, Qualcomm also provided similar reference designs for lower-cost phones. This lowered the barriers to entry for customized devices, increasing market competition.As barriers to entry continue to lower and the number of entrants soars, the value-added diminishes. Huawei and ZTE's white-label OEM phones are barely surviving, with extremely low profit margins, yet they are ensnared in a paradox of steady sales and an unwillingness to let go.<TRANSLATION>
3. Almost Sold Like Foxconn
Within less than six years of its establishment, the revenue of H3C grew from 600 million RMB (2003) to nearly 10 billion RMB (2008), with an annual compound growth rate reaching 15 times. In November 2006, Huawei sold all of its 49% stake in H3C for $880 million to 3COM. On June 6, 2006, Huawei acquired Harbour Networks, founded by Li Yinan, including its core R&D assets and talents in routers and switches. In 2006, Ren Zhengfei strategically engaged in both acquisitions and divestitures. In November 2007, John Chambers, Chairman and CEO of Cisco, visited China for the sixth time, announcing a substantial investment of $16 billion in China over the next 3 to 5 years, which prompted Huawei to pay close attention to IP switches, routers, security, and storage products. Selling off subsidiaries and businesses did not mean Huawei was completely abandoning these areas. It was simply a strategic pause; after a few years when the agreement period ended, Huawei planned to re-enter these fields with its developed R&D capabilities. In March 2008, Huawei established a joint venture with software giant Symantec, called Huawei Symantec, thus completing its product layout against Cisco and H3C: networking, security, video, and storage. Clearly, when a significant opportunity arose, Huawei needed more capital to invest in this area. In 2007, Huawei's debt grew by 47.4% over 2006, amounting to an increase of $2.29 billion; accounts receivable grew by 54.5% relative to 2006, outpacing revenue growth; the ratio of cash flow to revenue decreased by 12.9%; accounts receivable climbed to more than 50% of total assets, creating substantial pressure on capital recovery. Huawei's operating profit margin declined from 19% in 2003 to 7% in 2007, while the net profit margin fell from 14% to 5%.
</TRANSLATION>In 2007, Huawei's mobile terminal division experienced a compound annual growth rate of 72%, yet it faced substantial investment with slim profits. Profits from data cards began to significantly decline; the CDMA mobile market was concentrated in only a few markets; and the volume of WCDMA phones was insufficient to sustain sales. These factors heightened the risks in Huawei's mobile business operations. Apart from self-developed WCDMA phones, other standard phones primarily utilized strategies of complete device procurement, outsourced design, and contract manufacturing. In bidding for operator projects, Huawei occasionally packaged terminals with equipment for sale, even at the cost of reducing profits from its popular mobile terminal models to enhance the price competitiveness of the overall solution. Mobile terminals, not being Huawei's core business, were considered assets suitable for divestiture during economic downturns. In May 2008, Huawei issued a purchase invitation to at least five private equity funds including Bain Capital, Blackstone Group, and KKR, to sell at least 49% of its equity, requesting non-binding bids by June 23. This was also an attempt by Huawei to spin off and go public, with Morgan Stanley serving as Huawei's consulting team for this acquisition, while Bain Capital and Silver Lake Partners' consulting teams were from J.P. Morgan, UBS, and Deutsche Bank respectively. Huawei's publicly disclosed mobile terminal business had a sales revenue of $2.6 billion in 2007, accounting for 16.4% of Huawei's total sales revenue for the year, with 70% coming from overseas markets, and a net profit of $400 million. Huawei's terminal business includes five product lines: mobile phones, mobile broadband (data cards), fixed network terminals (fixed stations), converged terminals, and video terminals, with mobile phones only accounting for 42% of total sales revenue. Mobile broadband, fixed network terminals, xDSL modems, and 3G gateways all hold the top global market share. From another perspective, this was not an opportune time to sell the mobile terminal business. The economic downturn led to a decrease in consumer purchasing power, rising raw material prices led to increased production costs, and the mobile phone industry faced dual pressures of price and cost, with Nokia, holding 40% of the global mobile phone market share, seeing its stock price cumulatively fall by 36%.In the eyes of investment analysts, Huawei's terminal company specialized in Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) mobile phone production for companies like Vodafone, akin to Foxconn. Due to a 56% decline in profits in the first half of 2007, Foxconn's stock price continued to fall, with its price-to-earnings ratio dropping from 10 times in June to about 8 times. According to Huawei's target price, the mobile terminal company would be sold for at least four billion dollars, which is ten times its net profit in 2007. However, if compared to Foxconn's price-to-earnings ratio, it would only be 3.2 billion dollars. On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers, the fourth largest investment bank in the US, filed for bankruptcy protection, and Merrill Lynch, the third largest, was acquired by Bank of America. This impacted the New York stock market significantly, causing the three major stock indices to experience a dramatic plunge on the 15th, marking the largest single-day drop since the 9/11 incident. The onset of the US financial crisis was officially declared, putting major US investment funds in a state of tight capital contraction. On September 27, 2008, after several rounds of bidding, only Bain Capital and Silver Lake, two private equity firms, remained in the final bidding. However, their final bids were only three-quarters of Huawei's expected price. The turmoil on Wall Street not only affected the direction of this nearly four billion dollar transaction but also halted Huawei's initial attempt to go public through a spin-off. In October 2008, Huawei publicly stated that due to the sudden deterioration of the global financial trend, it was suspending the sale of its terminal division's equity. Technologically and trend-wise, Huawei had been in a following state for many years, customizing networks and mobile terminals for operators without achieving a leading business-driven business model change, remaining in a reactive position. Huawei was relieved that the financial crisis did not lead to the terminal company being sold at a reduced price, but this also reflected that Huawei's technological strategy was still far from visionary companies like Apple, and Huawei continued to be a typical example of a Chinese company playing catch-up. However, Huawei's catch-up approach is based on a continuously improving and updating management system, allowing Huawei to constantly correct mistakes and reform itself.

Companies often fall into a sales trap, where there are sales but no profit. Sales, production, procurement, and R&D departments are all pleased because sales generate activity and justify increases in staffing and wages. But has the company fallen into a 'red ocean' of intense competition? Relying entirely on low-cost competition, has it lost the ability to create unique added value and brand effects? Prosperity without core competitiveness is often superficial and ephemeral, as competitors are likely to undercut you with even lower prices.
