C2 From Operators to Consumers, from B2B to B2C  
Introduction  
From 2011 to 2013, Huawei continuously adjusted its strategy and underwent organizational changes over three years, achieving a tenfold increase in growth and becoming the world's third-largest smartphone company. During this period, online and open market channel sales accounted for 80%, while operator channel sales made up only 20%, thus becoming a typical B2C company. Huawei achieved dual success in its mobile brand and profits, successfully establishing Honor, the fastest-growing internet mobile brand globally. Through self-innovation and re-entrepreneurship, Huawei made comprehensive breakthroughs in new business areas, serving as a successful example of traditional enterprises transitioning to the internet. In response to the rapidly evolving external environment, Huawei timely adjusted its strategy and organization, actively sought competitive opportunities against its rivals, and achieved rapid breakthroughs along the way. These experiences offer valuable lessons for many traditional enterprises that depend on outdated business models and channels and struggle to successfully transform.  
1. How to Break the Cycle of Competing Without Advantages
</TRANSLATION><TRANSLATION>
During the Spring Festival in February 2010, at the Mobile World Congress (MWC 2010) in Barcelona, Spain, Guo Ping, chairman of Huawei's terminal division, stated that Huawei might once again try to spin off its terminal division, which produces mobile phones and data cards, and take it public. In 2008, Huawei's terminal company had sales of $4 billion, which rose to approximately $5 billion in 2009. The plan for 2010 was to achieve $6 billion in revenue, which would represent a year-on-year growth of 20%. This marked a slowdown from the previous growth rate of 70%. From 2005 to 2008, Guo Ping led Huawei's terminal company, and in 2008, Chen Chao-hui succeeded him, but in 2009, Tao Jingwen took over. Huawei's terminal management team saw frequent changes. The terminal business had already accounted for 20% of Huawei's overall revenue, but it was clear that Ren Zhengfei and Huawei's senior management were uncertain about the future direction of the terminal division at that time. At 1 a.m. on June 8, 2010, Apple CEO Steve Jobs launched the new iPhone 4. The iPhone 4 far surpassed the iPhone 3GS in functionality, with over a hundred upgrades. The newly launched iPhone 4 immediately became the most sought-after device among mobile phone enthusiasts. The 16GB model of the iPhone 4 was priced at 4,999 yuan, and the 32GB model at 5,999 yuan. In the mobile phone market, the iPhone 4 had no price advantage, yet it still achieved impressive sales. In the domestic market, China Unicom secured the "exclusive selling rights" for the iPhone 4 and officially launched it on September 25, 2010. The reaction from buyers after the launch was nothing short of frenzied, with long queues at all sales points and newspapers competing to cover the story, setting an astonishing record of 60,000 units sold on the first day. Looking back at the evolution of Apple's iPhone: R&D started in 2005, the iPhone 2G was launched on June 29, 2007, with total sales of 3 million units in 2007; the iPhone 3G was launched on July 11, 2008, with total sales of 4.4 million units in 2008; the iPhone 3GS was launched on June 9, 2009, with total sales of 25.1 million units in 2009; and the iPhone 4 was launched on June 8, 2010, with total sales of 46.6 million units in 2010. From June 29, 2007, to December 2010, Apple's iPhone series smartphones had cumulative global sales exceeding 90 million units, averaging over $150 profit per iPhone. Apple had become the most profitable company in the world. In the smartphone rankings of 2009, Samsung was still at the bottom, unable to break into the top five. Samsung's sudden push into smartphones occurred in 2010. In April 2010, Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee personally ordered the establishment of a special smartphone R&D team in Suwon, South Korea. In June 2010, just two months later, Samsung launched its first Android system smartphone, the Galaxy.
</TRANSLATION><TRANSLATION>
In the following four months, the Galaxy S sold 5 million units globally, averaging over a million units per month, approaching the total of all HTC models combined. Samsung, with just one phone, undermined HTC's product proliferation strategy, selling 5 million units in four months and becoming the new dominant player in the Android smartphone market. The advent of 3G created a window of opportunity for the industry, with Apple leading a transformation in the mobile industry, resulting in rapid growth in the global smartphone market. The smartphone business became a strategic industry that IT manufacturers, telecom companies, and even internet enterprises competed to enter. Statistics released by the U.S. market research firm IDC on the 7th indicated that global smartphone shipments reached 302.6 million units in 2010, a staggering increase of 74.4% compared to the previous year. The significant sales growth of Android phones contributed to the overall expansion of the smartphone market. Samsung's Android-based mobile terminals saw their shipments increase more than fourfold, jumping from the top ten to fourth place globally. However, in 2010, while Apple and Samsung were making significant strides, Huawei's mobile terminal division was in a state of transition. In March and April 2007, Huawei's data cards sold for around 2,000 RMB in Europe, but by May 2008, the shipping price had plummeted to 500 RMB, with the sales price dropping several times within a year, shifting from substantial profits to marginal profitability. By 2010, Huawei's data cards could only sell for a little over 20 euros in Europe, yielding only thin margins. In 2010, ZTE's mobile terminal made market adjustments, prioritizing scale growth, which grew rapidly despite a significant decline in profit margins, putting considerable pressure on Huawei's mobile terminal. After the profits from Huawei's data cards were diminished, the mobile business could no longer support sufficient market and R&D investments. The glorious history of Huawei's terminal division, which had relied solely on its data card product line, was no longer sustainable, forcing Huawei's terminal to find new breakthroughs. However, in 2010, Huawei's mobile terminal business also generated some new highlights.

Rubin) founded Android Inc., which was acquired and invested in by Google in August 2005. In November 2007, Google formed the Open Handset Alliance with 84 hardware manufacturers, software developers, and telecom operators to jointly develop and improve the Android system. Subsequently, Google released the source code for Android under the Apache open source license. The first Android smartphone was launched in October 2008. Huawei became one of the first companies in China to join the Open Handset Alliance, and in February 2009, Huawei showcased its first Android smartphone at the Mobile World Congress in Spain, making it the first Android smartphone in China. In 2010, Huawei's mobile terminal also launched the Huawei U8800, which was the world's first smartphone to support HSPA+ networks (with a maximum download speed of 21 Mbps, faster and more advanced than 3G, and recognized as a standard for 4G networks), and also launched the world's first popular Android 2.2 smartphone, the IDEOS. After nearly two years of effort, Huawei's terminal finally developed a smartphone priced at 1,000 yuan. However, in 2010, compared to Apple's and Samsung's shipment volumes of 46.6 million units, Huawei's smartphone shipments were only 5 million units, with its market share being virtually nonexistent and a very low proportion compared to feature phones within the company. In 2010, Huawei's terminal division found itself at a crossroads, facing the choice to advance or retreat, as it encountered significant challenges while its scale was increasing. When it was smaller, Huawei's mobile terminal engaged in guerrilla marketing strategies, focusing on niche markets and operator customization, which made it easier to win battles. However, by 2010, as its scale grew, it faced the need to engage in large-scale battles, while its competitors gradually emerged as industry leaders, leading to a loss of direction in its future development. Coordinating resources within the company became increasingly difficult for Huawei's terminal division, and many employees felt that cooperation between departments was often forced. While Apple rapidly gained global popularity through its chip design, software, and ecosystem advantages, Huawei's terminal company felt a significant lack of internal collaborative capabilities, with coordination being very challenging and a lack of strong organizational support and large platform backing. This sentiment was personally expressed by Ren Zhengfei in 2010: At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, someone was using a Huawei phone but couldn't connect to Huawei's cloud? How could there be no internal connection? Additionally, some terminal products were in conflict as multiple departments within Huawei were developing them simultaneously: sales personnel in Western Europe discovered that some terminals were not solely developed by the terminal company, but also by Huawei's network division.
</TRANSLATION><TRANSLATION>
also under development, and Huawei's software company is also in development. For example, there are conflicts among several departments in the market concerning IPTV set-top boxes; there are also conflicts regarding PON terminals in fixed-line terminals, as the future direction of ADSL gateways is towards PON. When customers find out that Huawei is having internal conflicts, they are confused... With Apple and Samsung leading the way and ZTE having invested heavily in the mobile terminal field for over a decade, Huawei's mobile terminal has become confused about its future development direction, both internally and externally. Below are various expressions of confusion from within Huawei's mobile terminal at the end of 2010. Huawei focuses on supporting operator system equipment and maintains a relatively low profile both internally and externally. In the brand communication work for Huawei's mobile terminal products, staff from the terminal company often face certain promotional restrictions, such as not being able to use celebrity endorsements and not being able to advertise in news and financial publications. The terminal is a trendy and continually innovative product. Can Huawei's terminal company push past these restrictions? The sales channels for mobile terminals are limited, primarily sold through operator-customized channels. As consumer electronics, channel development is very important. What are Huawei's overall plans and strategies for channel development? Huawei's regional departments facing the globe serve as the local sales platform for Huawei products. However, in practice, mobile terminal products make up less than 10% of the total KPI assessment for the current regional marketing platform, and how Huawei's mobile terminal performs is not a major concern for them. At the same time, in recent years, Huawei's mobile terminal has paid substantial management fees to Huawei's larger platform each year, including platform fees, which account for more than three points of sales revenue (the R&D investment in Huawei's mobile terminal products is also quite limited). How can Huawei's large platform play a role in supporting the development of terminal business? The Huawei mobile terminal company was established at the end of 2003 to support Huawei's network technology system. After seven years of development, the terminal company still does not have a new positioning within the entire Huawei Group. Is the terminal company an essential part of the Huawei Group, or does it merely serve as a supporting product line? How can it collaborate with the larger platform? What are Huawei's expectations for the future of its mobile terminals? Compared to Huawei's 20 years of experience in operator network equipment, its terminal division started late and has encountered numerous challenges, as the competition for Huawei mobile phones is...
</TRANSLATION><TRANSLATION>
The competitors are top global technology companies like Apple. In contrast, Huawei has over 20 years of experience in operating carrier network equipment, and even Nokia and Ericsson are no longer competitors, leading to more victories. In terms of profit contribution to Huawei and performance evaluation, the benefits enjoyed by those in the carrier network equipment sector far exceed those of personnel in the terminal company. Once the executives within Huawei's larger platform advance, they smoothly become vice presidents and presidents of regional departments. However, very few personnel from the mobile terminal company transition to senior leadership roles in other departments at Huawei. What career development opportunities exist for personnel in Huawei's mobile terminal company? Investment in research and innovation is lacking; for instance, mobile broadband (data cards) has experienced explosive growth in recent years, achieving a good market share, but competition with similar products from rivals is intensifying. How can we secure research and development funding for mobile terminals given the low profit margins and sales? With many newcomers in Huawei's terminal company, how can we instill the core values of Huawei's culture to better support the terminal business's development? Should Huawei's mobile terminals engage in cutthroat price competition, or should they make adjustments? Among the world's major terminal companies, only Apple and Huawei lack their own production capabilities; Huawei has never had its own production capacity. As it aims to achieve 100 million, 200 million, or even 300 million units in the future, should this strategy persist? Over the past seven years, Huawei Group has imposed strict inventory targets on the terminal company, and previously, the mobile terminal business was just a trial, aiming to avoid significant risks. In the consumer goods industry, inventory always accompanies its growth. However, now that an offensive strategy is required, are there new inventory requirements? Huawei's mobile terminals must achieve product regionalization, nationalization, and localization, but the greatest challenge lies in the multitude of regions and countries worldwide. In attempting to integrate regional content, Huawei lacks a solid platform to support this; how can this be accomplished?
</TRANSLATION><TRANSLATION>
Mobile phones are the products closest to consumers, which makes them quite challenging to master. Selling consumer goods is fundamentally about understanding people, and while Huawei has previously excelled in system equipment, its understanding of consumer behavior is still lacking. How can Huawei differentiate its mobile phones from those of its competitors and achieve success? From a sales perspective, Huawei's mobile terminal faces two types of customers: one is operators for resale, and the other is partners in the open market. With a focus on reducing barriers, how can Huawei ensure effective collaboration with its partners? The business and transaction models for mobile terminals are constantly evolving and changing like water. How should Huawei's mobile terminal company and the entire delivery platform respond to the uncertainty of results with a certain set of rules? In the mobile industry chain, brand manufacturers can add value to products through branding, while manufacturers without a brand can reduce product costs through factories to gain low-cost competitiveness. Currently, Huawei's mobile terminal lacks both capabilities. What direction should it take moving forward? Huawei's senior management insists that mobile terminals must become fashionable, yet in practice, the most frequently used terms in all mobile projects are "ultra-low price," "ultra-bottom price," and "ultra-low-end." How can these guiding principles foster a sense of fashion? Huawei's mobile phones have neither cost advantages nor technological advantages, placing them in a precarious position. How can they emerge from this situation? Has Huawei's management demonstrated a commitment to reform and optimization regarding business models, capability enhancement, and distribution mechanisms? Internally, intense debates have emerged regarding the future direction of Huawei's mobile terminal, but everyone has also recognized the significant opportunities presented by Apple's high-priced sales worldwide: Apple has achieved remarkable sales and profit growth through its strategy of releasing a premium iPhone every two years. In just four years, Apple launched four models, achieving a market value of over $260 billion, becoming the world's most valuable company and a leader in global technology enterprises. The rapid success of Apple and Samsung in the smartphone market has sparked a desire for change within Huawei's management.  
2. The Zunyi Conference of Huawei's Mobile Transformation
</TRANSLATION><TRANSLATION>
On December 3, 2010, Ren Zhengfei organized a senior meeting which was attended by Xu Zhijun, Guo Ping, Tao Jingwen, Deng Biao, Wan Biao, Yu Chengdong, and over 200 core personnel from Huawei's mobile terminal company (including phone connections). The theme of this meeting was ultimately about being bold in action while remaining humble, following the principles of consumer goods, and having the courage to pursue maximum growth and success. During this meeting, Ren Zhengfei redefined the role of the terminal business, including the positioning of Huawei's mobile terminal company within the organization and in the mobile industry. It was clarified that the terminal company plays a crucial strategic role within Huawei, alongside the core businesses of the operator pipeline and enterprise network. At the same time, in establishing brand direction, the previously cautious terminal company, which had been held back by various traditional internal mindsets, was encouraged to act boldly according to the rules of consumer goods, changing Huawei's past strategy of not building a brand and investing heavily in brand management, consumer psychology research, and product planning. Ren Zhengfei reminded Huawei's senior management and the core personnel of the mobile terminal company that becoming a global leader in the mobile terminal field would require a long-term commitment, possibly ten years or more, and that they should clearly define their phased goals. Furthermore, there should be substantial increases in research and development and branding investments for mobile terminals, at least surpassing competitors in budget and investment. To eliminate departmental barriers and prevent overlap between business and products during ICT integration, Huawei had already initiated solutions in 2010 to integrate related product groups, transforming related product groups into solutions based on customer needs: pipeline solutions, enterprise business solutions, and consumer goods solutions. Huawei formed a unified large platform through resource integration, centered around four operational centers, providing support through a customer-focused operational center (pipeline, enterprise business, consumer goods, and others) to support its rapid growth. This division of the four operational centers effectively addressed the insufficient support and resources that Huawei's mobile terminal had faced within the company over the past seven years, ensuring the mobile terminal business receives the same level of resource support as the operator pipeline, its main business. Regarding the production of Huawei mobile phones, Ren Zhengfei instructed that outsourcing should be pursued while maintaining core production capabilities, reviving a lean and efficient manufacturing capacity, and seeking expertise from Japan and South Korea to learn. From the very first day of the establishment of Huawei's mobile terminal, Ren Zhengfei stressed the importance of avoiding two major pitfalls in mobile phone development: internal corruption and inventory issues, and he was resolute on this point.
</TRANSLATION><TRANSLATION>
The two major deadlocks in development are internal corruption and inventory; this is a non-negotiable point. Regarding Huawei's mobile terminal genuinely facing the future with reforms and innovating its business model and technology, Ren Zhengfei could not offer a miraculous solution at this meeting; instead, he delegated the challenging issues of innovation to the executives and key personnel present. He also suggested learning from Samsung and Apple, as well as interpreting and learning from local competitor ZTE. If we focus on improving ourselves, why worry about not becoming number one someday? Ren Zhengfei is not Steve Jobs and cannot immediately answer which product will make Huawei number one; he simply redirected the team's focus back to strengthening its organizational and management system. By clearly positioning the still-weak Huawei mobile terminal business as one of the company's three major strategic main channels, he adjusted the organizational structure and increased strategic investment to ensure that they invest more than their competitors. Enhancing one's competitive capability is the most important thing. In the midst of confusion and chaos, Ren Zhengfei repeatedly emphasized that Huawei's mobile terminal must actually change itself, starting with internal factors, first changing the internal and external distribution mechanisms. The internal distribution mechanism emphasizes that the terminal company should adopt a low salary, high reward structure, establishing a correct profit distribution mechanism. Without reforming the distribution mechanism, dreams cannot be realized. The reason the mobile terminal business has not developed well enough is still due to issues with the incentive mechanism; those who do not contribute earn quite a bit, while those who work hard earn very little, lacking a reasonable incentive mechanism. Strengthening the profit-sharing mechanism should take cues from Apple, which has the best profit-sharing mechanism in the world. Without a proper distribution and profit-sharing mechanism, conquering the market is impossible. It is emphasized that a leader's responsibility is to bear the burden and deliver results; only in the face of results can there be benefits and status for the team. One must take the initiative to cultivate and select leaders, as leaders are promoted from within. The terminal company must be willing to embrace newcomers, and mid-level and grassroots cadres should focus on those who can get things done. At a time when the Huawei terminal company is engulfed in confusion, Ren Zhengfei emphasized that one must be bold enough to win to excel at winning. Victory in war is essential. Strategies must be thought out in terms of how to achieve victory. Ren Zhengfei quickly aligned perspectives through discussions with hundreds of mid- to senior-level personnel, pointing the way forward for everyone.

3. Selecting the right leader is crucial for success in any business endeavor.  
</TRANSLATION><TRANSLATION>
The Huawei terminal company is facing significant opportunities and challenges, caught in a perilous situation with "white bandits" ahead and "imperial troops" behind, making it imperative to appoint a new leader under immense pressure. Although Yu Chengdong spoke little at the meeting, he vowed to fight to the death alongside the terminal company to execute Ren Zhengfei's instructions: "The boss is right; our ability to understand demand and develop products reflects our capabilities. The entire team must adopt an open mindset and be willing to innovate. In this regard, the boss criticized me for lacking humility, and I acknowledge that I need to be more humble. I believe we have a one-year advantage over Ericsson in the wireless sector. In the terminal field, are we bold enough to declare our intentions and fight together as a team? We must have execution; without execution, it’s all just talk; departments need to collaborate. In the past few days, I participated in discussions on terminal BP and felt that the work is fragmented, with everyone doing their own thing, lacking a clear battle direction and not forming a cohesive force. Without execution, it’s just empty talk; we need to have execution. Everyone should be sharp in market analysis, hoping to stand higher, see further, and look deeper than our competitors. Our minimum goal is to surpass and win against local rivals. If we can’t win and can’t surpass them, I won’t be able to be the terminal CMO, nor the platform CMO. I have come to understand this point deeply, and we must strive to achieve it. Everyone can share their thoughts; we need to plan before taking action. Next year, we want to launch a flagship model. If we don’t have something truly exceptional, giving away phones will only lead to them being discarded. When will everyone throw away their iPhones and use our products? Whether we can achieve this depends on our team’s efforts; we must act diligently." Yu Chengdong's tenacity, courage against formidable competitors, exceptional execution, and determination to win have made a lasting impression on everyone. In this chaotic environment, it’s not about theoretical competition but about execution and courage, demanding a fighting spirit. Some may be seen as "unreasonable," even "obsessive," yet they embody a "fighter" spirit, and Yu Chengdong is precisely the strong leader most likely to integrate the existing large team of Huawei terminals. Following the meeting, at the start of 2011, Yu Chengdong, recognized for his tenacity, ability to tackle tough challenges, and significant achievements in wireless, marketing, and R&D, was appointed to lead the terminal company. Huawei's senior management recognizes that the current passive state of Huawei's mobile phones cannot be reversed without a driven leader like Yu Chengdong. He is the ideal candidate.
</TRANSLATION><TRANSLATION>
(1) Dare to tackle tough challenges and set ambitious goals. Yu Chengdong does not acknowledge fourth place; if you're going to do it, aim for the top three—specifically, first place. Many at Huawei have become complacent, just going through the motions, and when faced with challenges, they often retreat and lower the team's targets and standards. In contrast, Yu Chengdong continually leads his team to challenge the toughest goals and aim for the biggest targets. Every time KPIs are signed, many in Yu Chengdong's team face demotions or pay cuts, but in the end, they all savor the sweetness of victory. (2) A long-distance runner in the industry. Yu Chengdong joined Huawei in 1993, taking on roles such as 3G Product Director, Vice President of Wireless Product Marketing, President of the Wireless Product Line, President of the European Region, and President of the Strategy and Marketing System. Starting in 1997, he led the R&D team in developing WCDMA, launching the first commercial network in 2004, and by 2008, he had led Huawei to global leadership in WCDMA, enduring a grueling decade of hardship and solitude. Many during this time felt that working on WCDMA was a constant failure and, seeing no hope, switched departments or left the company. However, Yu Chengdong consistently persisted, leading his team to run towards the benchmark. For Huawei's terminals to compete globally, they need to realign with the paths that Apple and Samsung have taken over the past decade, thus the new leader for mobile terminals must possess the perseverance and endurance to endure solitude. (3) Not afraid of failure and undeterred by strong competitors. Huawei faced top competitors like Ericsson, the world leader in the WCDMA field, starting late and lagging in overall technology for many years, remaining in a passive position under competitive pressure for over a decade, making the development process exceptionally challenging. As the leader of the team, Yu Chengdong demonstrated strong psychological resilience, not only in handling setbacks but also in actively seeking opportunities to outpace competitors. (4) Ability to organize resources. As a veteran in the wireless product line, Yu Chengdong is skilled at mobilizing resources. With Huawei's WCDMA victories in Europe, former R&D personnel in the wireless product line have also grown into battle-hardened core members at various levels. Yu Chengdong, as a benchmark for mobile terminals, helps draw more talent from the wireless sector into Huawei's mobile terminal division. (5) A perfectionist who is relentless in his pursuit of success. In the past, the ongoing battles in GSM and WCDMA forced Huawei to consistently provide various resource support, from R&D to marketing.
</TRANSLATION><TRANSLATION>  
Yu Chengdong remained persistent in his efforts, refusing to give up even if there was just a slight chance. He continued to make phone calls to follow up until it was achieved. He insisted on developing the fourth-generation base station (Single RAN).  
</TRANSLATION><TRANSLATION>
Single RAN), integrating various technologies such as GSM, UMT, and SLT. The technology carries significant risks and high costs. If large-scale investments fall short of market expectations, Huawei could face years of struggle to recover amid considerable internal resistance. Nonetheless, this represents Huawei's sole opportunity to surpass Ericsson. Yu Chengdong mobilized all departments to fully commit resources, and ultimately Huawei Wireless made this significant breakthrough. "For many years, Huawei people have believed there is only first place, not second. Under my leadership, Huawei's terminal will either succeed or fail—there's no middle ground!" Yu Chengdong declared upon taking office.

4. Should we take a loss just to make a splash and grow our scale?
</TRANSLATION><TRANSLATION>
September 2011 was the most frustrating period for Huawei's mobile terminal company, as it faced pressure from Xiaomi for an entire month. On August 16, 2011, the Xiaomi 1 was released, and on August 17, the Baidu index for "Xiaomi Phone" hit 473,298. By September 5, pre-orders for the Xiaomi 1 reached 300,000 units in just 34 hours. Xiaomi pioneered the first Chinese internet smartphone, hitting traditional mobile manufacturers like Huawei hard. The skyrocketing sales and incredible word-of-mouth created a huge shockwave for Huawei's terminal division. Xiaomi's unconventional strategy left Huawei scrambling. Should they respond immediately? Could they keep pace? Debates were buzzing both inside and outside Huawei. The Xiaomi 1 boasted impressive specs at an unbeatable price: a 1.5GHz Qualcomm dual-core processor, a 4-inch Sharp touchscreen, and a 1930 mAh large-capacity battery.
</TRANSLATION><TRANSLATION>
a large-capacity 1930 mAh battery, priced at just 1999 yuan. The estimated hardware cost for large-scale shipments is around $200, which translates to between 1200 and 1300 yuan. However, this high-spec, low-price combination has created a frenzy among consumers, and within just a year of its establishment, Xiaomi, a company that had never produced phones before, quickly became the number one in China. Xiaomi attracted users starting with the MIUI operating system, claiming it profits from cloud services, which exposed Huawei's vulnerabilities. Huawei lacks the deep customization for enthusiasts that MIUI provides, as well as the hundreds of thousands of enthusiast forums and cloud services. How can Huawei swiftly integrate resources to catch up? Lei Jun announced: "The ultimate profit driver for internet companies is through services, not hardware." Compared to how many phones are sold, Xiaomi is more focused on the sensational effect brought by the release of this phone, attracting more users to register on its website, allowing them to become fans and users of the MIUI operating system and MiChat by providing them with a Xiaomi number. At that time, approximately 300,000 users in China were utilizing the MIUI operating system. Lei Jun stated that enthusiasts are the true opinion leaders; only if they like it can a phone "truly reach the masses." In terms of sales channels, Xiaomi, unencumbered by historical channel burdens, pioneered a model of selling exclusively through e-commerce channels, directly interacting with consumers. Should Huawei, which has primarily relied on operator channels, follow suit? Following suit would mean engaging in a tug-of-war with the operator channels that make up 90% of sales, potentially affecting the operator relationships built over more than 20 years. It could also result in price instability. The model of selling Xiaomi phones only through its own website maximizes the reduction of channel costs, cutting over 30% of intermediary costs and directly benefiting consumers, achieving the goal of rapidly expanding sales and establishing a brand known for high cost-performance through high specs at low prices. Xiaomi has disrupted the entire mobile phone industry, leaving phone manufacturers, including Huawei, in shock. In light of this new phenomenon, should Huawei quickly follow suit? What should Huawei's strategy be for following this trend?
</TRANSLATION><TRANSLATION>  
5. Prioritizing Consumers Instead of Carriers  
</TRANSLATION><TRANSLATION>
Samsung Electronics announced in October 2011 that its smartphone shipments reached 20 million units for the quarter, surpassing Apple. On December 15, 2011, Huawei's EMT reaffirmed its future development strategy for mobile terminals in key global markets, focusing on organization and talent, incentives, solutions and products, sales models, channels, and brand principles. The strategy particularly emphasized two points: Huawei's development of terminals must pursue profitability and be based on survival, rather than merely chasing scale and global ranking. The roadmap for Huawei's mobile development should focus on consumer demand, rather than operator demand. The foundation of Huawei's terminal industry competitiveness lies with the end consumer. Huawei's terminals should develop around a hardware platform, multiple operating systems, a middleware, and a UI technology strategy. The core of the brand is integrity. 1. Strategy (1) The foundation of Huawei's terminal industry competitiveness lies with the end consumer. The customers of mobile phones are the end consumers, and telecom operators are just one of the important sales channels for Huawei's phones. The roadmap for mobile development should be guided by the needs of end consumers, rather than those of operators. (2) Huawei's development of terminals must pursue profitability and be based on survival, rather than merely chasing scale and global ranking. Pursuing scale unrealistically could expose Huawei's terminal industry to significant operational risks. (3) Boldly enter the main channels and trends, ride the wave without gambling, and focus on the central part of the normal distribution. Collaborate with mainstream companies in the U.S., especially strengthening partnerships with Qualcomm, Google, Microsoft, etc., in the U.S. market. The terminal market presents many opportunities and challenges; the first question for the terminal strategy is not what to pursue, but what to forgo, and it must continuously enhance strategic focus. The formulation and execution of the strategy must be aligned; once a consensus is reached on the strategy, it must be implemented long-term and reflected in resource allocation. (4) Smartphones represent the largest market space, opportunity, and chance within the terminal sector; the first step is to seize the breakthrough in smartphones, then expand horizontally, ultimately providing solutions for all screens. (5) Adhere to end-cloud collaboration, building consumer-oriented solutions and core competitive advantages; maintain end-pipe collaboration to enhance differentiation and relative competitive advantages. (6) Quality is the foundation for terminal growth and development, and it must be prioritized. Maintain tight inventory management to prevent operational risks. 2. Organization, Talent, Incentives
</TRANSLATION><TRANSLATION>
(1) The development of Huawei's terminal business requires a proactive shift in mindset, culture, and organization. It is essential to move away from the operator network mentality and should not rely on the successful foundation built over the past 20 years. Instead, it should be based on the current situation and reality of the terminal, establishing a solid foundation for identity, system architecture, platforms, and core capabilities; at the same time, an open platform should be created to integrate innovative solutions from various sectors. (2) The terminal management team and the entire organization should foster diversity in talent and culture. It is important to believe in the power of expertise and to broadly attract talent from various fields, especially in industrial design, consumer psychology research, marketing innovation, and aesthetics, learning from industry best practices and attracting top talent. (3) The terminal company should adhere to a "low fixed costs, high flexibility" incentive approach, creating a more agile and responsive incentive system aligned with business rhythms and industry standards. It should dare to create disparities in treatment, incentivizing contributions and retaining talent through career development. 3. Solutions and Products (1) It is necessary to become part of the fashion landscape, leveraging insights from various fields (fashion, aesthetics, clothing, luxury goods, salons, etc.) to learn and understand consumer needs and development directions, developing products and applications that resonate with consumer needs. (2) Huawei's terminal should be centered on user experience, with the goal of achieving industry-leading experience design. It must separate experience design, appearance design, and R&D implementation, allowing user experience to drive product R&D and implementation, without sacrificing user experience and appearance design due to R&D limitations. (3) Huawei's terminal should develop around a single hardware platform, multiple operating systems, a middleware, and a UI technology strategy. A single hardware platform refers to ultimate standardization, aiming to eliminate the current issue of having too many hardware platforms. The vision of "one hardware platform" should be used to guide progress in hardware technology, guiding design and development to progressively meet these goals. The terminal company should quickly establish quantifiable hardware platform convergence goals and strategies for the next 3-5 years, achieving Huawei's strategic goal of being the industry leader in hardware competitiveness. (4) Industry partners are one of the core capabilities of the terminal company. Huawei's terminal should adopt an open and co-constructive mindset to collaborate with core partners, fostering a mutually beneficial partnership. (5) From now on, Huawei should invest in terminal operating systems and make good technical reserves. Huawei's goal in developing a terminal operating system is not merely to reduce IPR costs, but mainly for two reasons: first, to ensure a secure supply, ensuring the continuity of Huawei's terminal business even in challenging circumstances;

Secondly, to create value, enhance customer experience, and improve Huawei's competitiveness. Huawei's development of its terminal operating system should be centered in China. Once Huawei achieves significant sales (for example, shipping over 50 million units in the Chinese market), Huawei can consider launching its own operating system devices and developing an ecosystem around its own operating system. 4. Sales Models, Channels, and Branding (1) Sales models should be pragmatically designed to reflect regional market characteristics. In the U.S., Japan, and Europe, where telecom operators dominate, Huawei should continue to primarily conduct business through operators as the main channel and continuously build the Huawei terminal brand. In the BRICS countries and other markets where open channels dominate, there should be a strategic and focused gradual development of channel and e-commerce sales models. (2) Whether through operator resale, social channels, or e-commerce, Huawei must enhance the bargaining power of its mobile phones, with the brand being the core. Only by establishing the Huawei mobile phone brand among end consumers can Huawei encourage them to purchase and use its phones, allowing the value built on the phones to be realized. (3) Huawei should target key countries to establish its mobile phone brand. Integrity is at the core of the brand. A clear strategy and timely organizational adjustments will lead to a significant boost in productivity: in 2010, Huawei shipped just 5 million smartphones. In 2011, this surged to 20 million units, marking a several-fold increase. In 2012, Yu Chengdong made a bold commitment: based on completing 20 million units in 2011, Huawei must complete the task of 60 million smartphones in 2012, achieving a substantial leap in scale, brand recognition, and profit.
